# ML-Data-Science-application-
Predict the success or failure of an application through statistical approaches and machine learning.

In this work, we have tried to develop a prediction algorithm for job applications. We have at our disposal a .csv file that contains a number of characteristics describing a male/female job application. First, we will explore the dataset (.csv file) trying to understand the data and extract meaningful semantic relationships between the features (1.Descriptive statistics.ipynb). Then, we will develop machine learning algorithms to try to predict a hire (2.Data_Pre-processing_And_Modalization.ipynb).
